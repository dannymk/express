# Quick base express app (Use this as a starter)

```aiignore
git pull https://github.com/dannymk/express.git
cd express
npm install
node index.js
```

To access the app we use the port we specified in index.js

See line 4:  port 3000


Open your browser to that port and open the index.html page:

https://localhost:3000/index.html
